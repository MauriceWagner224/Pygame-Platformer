# Pygame-Platformer
This is a 2D-Platformer Game using sprites and elements of the sourcecode by [russ123](https://github.com/russs123/Platformer/tree/master).
The goal of this project is to educate beginners on how to use python and structues such as classes in OOP-fashion.

Pygame is a necessary library used widely throughout the project and it's documentation can be found here:

## Instructions on how to start working on the project.
[Pycharm-Edu 2022](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/other.html) was the IDE used throughout the project.

[pygame releases]() can be found on Github or directly downloaded by the pip command: pip install pygame==2.3.0

[pygame 2.3.0](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/releases/download/2.3.0/pygame-2.3.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl) for Python 3.11 and compiled for AMD64 is the version i used.

[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe) for 64-Bit Windows is the version I used.

##First Part:
Installing Pycharm Edu is pretty straightforward and can be installed without admin-privileges by denying admin-authentification after starting the installer.
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) has further instructions on how to install and get started in Pycharm

[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0-amd64.exe) should be installed next, so PyCharm has the correct version of Python installed. 
[Instructions](https://docs.python.org/3.11/using/windows.html#the-full-installer) on the setup and more can be found here.
#Important: Users without Admin-Privileges need to uncheck the installer Options 

[x] "Install for all Users" and [x] "Add Python to PATH" ==> [ ] "Install for all Users" and [ ] "Add Python to PATH"
Uncheck both options: ![image](https://github.com/MauriceWagner224/Pygame-Platformer/assets/79831881/4565c1b6-1d5f-4427-9b64-a6604acf5d98)
